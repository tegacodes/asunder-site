			<p>Asunder responds to a growing interest in the application of AI to critical environmental challenges by situating this as a literal proposition. An environmental manager proposes and simulates future landscape design strategies, questioning assumptions of computational neutrality, and the broader ideological framing of the environment as a system </p>

			<p>
			Satellite, climate, geology, biodiversity and topography for a series of terrestrial regions is used to generate an ever evolving series of environmental management plans where human and non-human agendas are combined and weighted in different ways. A central argument made by those encouraging the uptake of AI, is that data driven systems can depoliticize or neutralize decision making. Extended to the context of ecosystems, this could imply that ecological agendas are prioritized over human goals (and over the status quo where human systems of production are preserved at the expense of everything else). </p>

			<p>
				The work is structured into discrete simulations for different regions, positioning ecosystem as computational surface. As cities are relocated, nations combined, coastlines straightened or rivers moved, the work shifts between humorous to proposterous, from uncannily eco-fetishistic to tediously bureaucratic.
