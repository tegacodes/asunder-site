			<h2>Description:</h2>

			<p>Asunder responds to a growing interest in the application of AI to critical environmental challenges by situating this as a literal proposition. Through the development of an autonomous environmental manager that proposes and simulates future landscape design strategies, the work questions assumptions of computational neutrality, and the broader ideological framing of the environment as a system 

Using artificial intelligence techniques, the autonomous manager analyzes satellite, climate, geology, biodiversity, topographic, population, census and social media data for a series of terrestrial regions. It then generate an ever evolving series of environmental management plans where human and non-human agendas are combined and weighted in different ways. A central argument made by those encouraging the uptake of AI, is that data driven systems can depoliticize or neutralize decision making. Extended to the context of ecosystems, this could imply that ecological agendas are prioritized over human goals (and over the status quo where human systems of production are preserved at the expense of everything else). 

The work is structured into discrete simulations for different regions, positioning ecosystem as computational surface. As cities are relocated, nations combined, coastlines straightened or rivers moved, the work shifts between humorous to horrific, from uncannily eco-fetishistic to tediously bureaucratic. Each simulation will be projected across a triptych of screens. The left panel will consist of the analysis, showing satellite data and imagery of the region and its outlook. The central screen will show the process of the solver, running through various options and permeations, displaying program logs, text and data. The right panel will simulate the proposed “solution” shown through animation and visually manipulated satellite imagery.
